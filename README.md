# MILKY-BabyStable
MILKY, Milky BabyStable is a elastic stablecoin, pegged on 1 liter organic goats milk
It is launched at 1/4 of the full peg price.
That means it must grow over time towards full peg. This will be reached, if the collateral value will grow as much.
This makes MILKY a mixture of speculativ utility token and stablecoin. It will behave like other speculativ coins, until the full peg is reached.
All Mambo stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies.
They are not build on thin air. If the value of the collateral sinks below peg. the sell back rate on MamboSwap will go done too.
Milky was launched on October 3, 2021 at MILO (Mambo Initial Launch Offering) on MamboSWAP.
MamboSwap is the Mambo Automated Fixed Rates Exchange (MAFRE).
Because the rates are fixed, there is no slippage caused with a trade.
